# AI build log

This log records material AI assistance used to build ShaidaGo. It is evidence of reviewed collaboration, not a claim that generated output was accepted without inspection.

For each entry, record the task, prompt summary, material suggestion, human review outcome, verification, and resulting commit or pull request. Do not include secrets, private report content, personal data, hidden chain-of-thought, or sensitive exploit detail.

## 2026-09-19 — Repository foundation

- **Task:** Orient the edited workspace, reconcile planning documents, establish repository standards, organise documentation, and prepare the project for GitHub.
- **Prompt summary:** Create an enterprise-grade `AGENTS.md`, arrange the documents cleanly, preserve existing edits, and make ShaidaGo a GitHub repository suitable for hackathon grading.
- **AI assistance used:** Proposed the documentation hierarchy, repository governance files, code-review invariants, and consistency corrections for pilot location, languages, and the accepted BFF architecture.
- **Human review:** Pending maintainer review. Update this field with accepted, changed, or rejected decisions before treating the entry as closed.
- **Verification:** Repository hygiene, links, secret patterns, Git state, and remote settings are checked during handoff; application tests are not applicable before scaffolding.
- **Result:** Repository foundation prepared; application implementation remains at Gate 0.

## 2026-09-19 — License selection

- **Task:** Select and add an appropriate open-source license for the public hackathon repository.
- **Prompt summary:** Add a license suitable for a hackathon project.
- **AI assistance used:** Selected the OSI-approved MIT License because its short, permissive terms allow use, modification, distribution, sublicensing, and sale while retaining the copyright, permission notice, and warranty disclaimer.
- **Human review:** The maintainer authorised selection of an appropriate license; the exact license addition remains reviewable in commit history.
- **Verification:** The license text was checked against the Open Source Initiative template, repository references were updated, and GitHub license detection was checked after publication.
- **Result:** ShaidaGo is licensed under MIT, copyright 2026 Aniekan Winner Anietie.

## 2026-09-19 — Detailed backend and frontend build orders

- **Task:** Convert the accepted architecture into implementation-grade backend and frontend sequences that lower-capability coding models can execute without inventing requirements or trust boundaries.
- **Prompt summary:** Create a no-stone-unturned backend build order, then a frontend build order, grouping each task into a closed circle that explains every aspect of completion.
- **AI assistance used:** Produced dependency maps, closed-circle execution rules, 72 backend task packets, 91 frontend task packets, entry/exit gates, adversarial cases, verification evidence, and handoff templates. The frontend order also includes a mandatory human-approved visual-world gate and bounded finish-review workflow.
- **Human review:** Pending maintainer review. The task IDs and ordering are proposals constrained by the accepted implementation plan; record changes or approval before treating the orders as frozen.
- **Verification:** Both documents passed unique task-heading checks, local Markdown-link resolution, and whitespace validation. Cross-links in the README, documentation index, and implementation plan were updated.
- **Result:** Backend and frontend work now have explicit, dependency-ordered execution specifications; implementation remains at Gate 0.
